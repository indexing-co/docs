# Overview
Neighborhoods are distributed clusters of nodes at your service. The primary way to work with them today is via pipelines.

Each pipeline consists of:
1. List of [networks](/networks) to subscribe to
2. Filter (e.g. wallet addresses)
2. Transformation step (JavaScript)
3. Destination (Postgres, Webhooks)

# Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an authentication header, `X-API-KEY`.
