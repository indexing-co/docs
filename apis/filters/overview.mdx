Filters can come in many forms, but there are a couple primary use cases: wallet and contract addresses.

Filters also work _twice_ per pipeline:

1. They are applied for each network beat to determine if a beat should even be processed.
2. After processing, the resulting records are filtered again using the pipeline's `filterKeys`.

# Example

Let's say we want to filter `vitalik.eth`'s token transfers.

We'd first [add a filter](/apis/filters/add) for his address, `0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045`.

From there, we could test the following transformation against an Ethereum block containing a token transfer (e.g. block 22062886 with [this tx](0x793e3bb9b8010aba03354383e8101641ed384799be444eaa980dab75cd80e5aa)):

```javascript
// vitalik-example.js
function vitalikTokenTransfers(block) {
  const erc20Transfers = [];

  for (const tx of block.transactions) {
    for (const log of tx.receipt?.logs) {
      const decoded = utils.evmDecodeLog(log, [
        'event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)',
      ]);

      if (decoded) {
        erc20Transfers.push({
          transaction_hash: tx.hash,
          log_index: log.logIndex,
          contract_address: log.address.toLowerCase(),
          from: decoded.from,
          to: decoded.to,
        });
      }
    }
  }

  return erc20Transfers;
}
```

NOTE: the above transformation does _not_ have its own filter step. Instead, we can specify during [testing](/apis/transformations/test) and in the [pipeline](/apis/pipelines/create) to filter by `from`, `to`, or both.

```bash
curl "https://app.indexing.co/dw/transformations/test?network=ethereum&beat=22062886&filter=vitalik&filterKeys\[0\]=to" -H 'x-api-key: <API KEY>' -F code=@./vitalik-example.js | jq
```

^ this will provide a filtered set of token transfers like this:

```json
[
  {
    "transaction_hash": "0x9515ed82d894cdaf6d6a6b5952f8438cdaad948e17c9d842deb5c3f311207bc6",
    "log_index": 2,
    "contract_address": "0x7e1fb1be92693ec1da42ee8dfc072990bf3a3000",
    "from": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "to": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  }
]
```
