title: How to Find and Use EVM Event Signatures in The Neighborhood
---

If you're building a pipeline in The Neighborhood and using transformation code to decode onchain events, getting the right event signatures is one of the most important steps.

This tutorial will walk you through:

- How to **find event signatures** from block explorers, source code, and documentation
- How to **format them correctly** for use in The Neighborhood
- How to use the **helper functions** in your transformation code
- Common issues to troubleshoot if events aren't being picked up

Let's start with the basics.

## How to Find Event Signatures

To decode EVM logs in The Neighborhood, you need the **original Solidity declaration** of each event you care about. Here are three reliable methods to find them:

---

### Method 1: From the Contract ABI (Etherscan or Block Explorer)

**Best for:** quick access to a list of event signatures

**Where to look:**

- Etherscan / Basescan → *Contract* tab → scroll to the **ABI** section

**How to use it:**

1. Copy the ABI JSON blob.
2. Search for entries with `"type": "event"`.
3. Look for the `name`, `inputs`, and `indexed` fields.

**Tip:** Paste a full `event` object or the whole ABI into an LLM and ask it to convert it into a correct Solidity declaration (more below with prompts).

**Example input:**

```
{
  "anonymous": false,
  "inputs": [
    { "indexed": true, "internalType": "address", "name": "reserve", "type": "address" },
    { "indexed": false, "internalType": "address", "name": "user", "type": "address" },
    { "indexed": true, "internalType": "address", "name": "onBehalfOf", "type": "address" },
    { "indexed": false, "internalType": "uint256", "name": "amount", "type": "uint256" },
    { "indexed": true, "internalType": "uint16", "name": "referralCode", "type": "uint16" }
  ],
  "name": "Supply",
  "type": "event"
}
```

**Expected output:**

```
event Supply(
  address indexed reserve,
  address user,
  address indexed onBehalfOf,
  uint256 amount,
  uint16 indexed referralCode
);
```

**Why it’s helpful:**

- ABI is guaranteed to be linked to the deployed contract
- Good fallback if the source code is hard to navigate or proxied

### Method 2: Logs from Real Transactions

**Best for:** verifying an event was actually emitted

**Where to look:**

- Etherscan (or another Block Explorer) → go to a transaction → *Logs* tab

**Example:**

Go to a [transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf19165aa860274af3e5e4e481a19cef15fd058c107d501d16e0db43d615759d5#eventlog) that triggered the event (in this case`Supply`) and expand the event:

- You'll see the decoded values
- You see the `Name` of the event (e.g. `Supply (index_topic_1 address reserve, address user, index_topic_2 address onBehalfOf, uint256 amount, index_topic_3 uint16 referralCode)`)
- You might also see the simplified event signature (e.g. `Supply(address,address,address,uint256,uint16)`)

**Caution:**

- These simplified signatures omit `indexed`
- Do **not** copy/paste them directly
- Use them to *identify the event*, then transform them into the right format (see below)

---

### Method 3: Protocol Documentation

**Best for:** learning event structure quickly

**Where to look:**

- Official docs or GitHub repos (e.g. [Aave dev docs](https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool))

**What to check:**

- Look for full Solidity definitions (not JSON ABI fragments)
- Confirm parameters, types, and `indexed` markers

**Watch out:**

- Docs might be out of date or auto-generated (especially from TypeScript ABIs)
- Double-check final signature with Etherscan source

## What Are Event Signatures and Why They Matter

Event signatures are the blueprint for decoding onchain activity in EVM-based blockchains. Every time a smart contract emits an event, it's logged onchain with a `topic0` — a keccak256 hash of the event's signature (name and argument types). If you want to index, decode, or filter on these logs, you need to provide the exact event signature.

In The Neighborhood, transformation code uses helper functions like `utils.evmDecodeLogWithMetadata()` to decode logs. These functions rely on an array of event signatures written in their **original Solidity declaration format** — no shortened types, renamed parameters, or reordered arguments.

Why this matters:

- `event Borrow(address indexed reserve, address user, uint256 amount)` ≠ `event Borrow(address reserve, address user, uint256 amount)` — `indexed` is part of the signature!
- `uint256` ≠ `uint8`, and `address[]` ≠ `address` — exact types must match the deployed contract.

Providing a mismatched or standardized version of the signature means The Neighborhood won't be able to match and decode that log, even if the event did fire.

## Formatting Signatures with an LLM

Once you've found the event structure, you need to convert it into the exact Solidity format expected by The Neighborhood.

You can use a large language model (like ChatGPT) to help with this by giving it a structured prompt. Here’s a sample query you can copy-paste:

**Example prompt:**

```
Transform this event in the exact original Solidity declaration format, as written in the source code — without any type widening, narrowing, or standardization.

Types must match the original source exactly (e.g., uint8 must stay uint8, int128 must stay int128, etc.).

Return the events only in this format as a JavaScript array for use in utils.evmDecodeLogWithMetadata.

Do not explain, alter formatting, or adjust types.

Output format:

const decodedWithMetadata = utils.evmDecodeLogWithMetadata(log, [
  'event ...',
  'event ...',
]);
```

**Advanced:** You can also paste an entire contract page (like from Etherscan) into ChatGPT if it supports long context windows.

**Example prompt for full page:**

```
Webpage: https://etherscan.io/address/0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2

Give me back all events from this contract in the exact original Solidity declaration format, as written in the source code — without any type widening, narrowing, or standardization.

Types must match the original source exactly (e.g., uint8 must stay uint8, int128 must stay int128, etc.).

Return the events only in this format as a JavaScript array for use in utils.evmDecodeLogWithMetadata.

Do not explain, alter formatting, or adjust types.

Output format:

const decodedWithMetadata = utils.evmDecodeLogWithMetadata(log, [
  'event ...',
  'event ...',
]);
```

This method is quick, scalable, and accurate when used carefully — just always double-check the types and match them to verified sources.

## Using Signatures in The Neighborhoods Helper Functions

Once you've formatted your event signatures correctly, you're ready to use them in your transformation code.

The Neighborhood provides several helper functions that make decoding EVM logs straightforward:

```
const decoded = utils.evmDecodeLog(log, [
  'event ...',
]);

const decodedWithMetadata = utils.evmDecodeLogWithMetadata(log, [
  'event ...',
]);

const topic0 = utils.evmMethodSignatureToHex('event Transfer(address,address,uint256)');
```

- Use `evmDecodeLog()` to decode logs into raw data.
- Use `evmDecodeLogWithMetadata()` if you also want the matching event name returned.
- Use `evmMethodSignatureToHex()` to convert a signature string to its `topic0` hash for filtering or debugging.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

If your event isn't being picked up:

- ✅ Double-check your signature format — types must match exactly, including `indexed`
- ✅ Confirm that the event was actually emitted using a block explorer
- ✅ Look for proxy contracts — your event might be emitted from a different implementation address
- ✅ Use `utils.evmMethodSignatureToHex()` to get `topic0` and verify it matches the log's first topic
