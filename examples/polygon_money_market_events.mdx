title: Polygon Money Market Events
---

## Introduction

In this guide, you'll build a real-time pipeline to track lending and borrowing activity from Polygon money markets AAVE and Compound V3. By listening to core protocol contracts, you'll capture events like deposits, borrows, repayments, and liquidations, then decode and stream them directly into your database. By the end, you'll have a working pipeline that decodes relevant contracts event logs and stores structured trade data for analysis or downstream use.

## Prerequisites

You’ll need:

- A Neighborhood API key. To get access, email [**hello@indexing.co**](mailto:hello@indexing.co)
- curl or Postman
- An active postgres database

## ⚙️ What You’ll Build

A pipeline that:

1. Listens to the majority of Polygon money market contracts and their events
2. Decodes them with the event metadata
3. Streams transformed data into a unified postgres table

## 🔄 Step 1: Add the Transformation Logic

We'll want to decode and return a unified set of in and out flows for known markets.

View the full code [here](https://github.com/indexing-co/docs/blob/main/examples/transformations/polygon_money_market_events.js)

## ✍️ Step 2: Create the Transformation

```bash
curl https://app.indexing.co/dw/transformations/polygon_money_market_events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>' \
  -F code=@./polygon_money_market_events.js
```

## 💽 Step 3: Create the Database

```sql
create table events (
  pool_address text,
  transaction_hash text,
  log_index int,
  timestamp timestamptz,
  wallet_address text,
  token_address text,
  amount numeric,
  primary key (pool_address, transaction_hash, log_index)
);
create index on events (wallet_address, timestamp desc);
```

## 🔗 Step 4: Create the Pipeline

```bash
curl https://app.indexing.co/dw/pipelines \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>' \
  -d '{
    "name": "polygon_money_market_events",
    "transformation": "polygon_money_market_events",
    "networks": [
      "polygon"
    ],
    "enabled": true,
    "delivery": {
      "adapter": "POSTGRES",
      "connectionUri": "postgres://...",
      "table": "liquidity_events",
      "uniqueKeys": ["pool_address", "transaction_hash", "log_index"]
    }
  }'
```

## 🥺 Step 5: Test the Stream

Once live, your database should receive events like:

```sql
select * from liquidity_events limit 10;
```

You can test this manually and end-to-end using:

```bash
curl --location 'https://app.indexing.co/dw/pipelines/polygon_money_market_events/test/polygon/XXX' -H 'X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>'
```

## 🚀 Wrap-Up

You've now set up a real-time stream of Polygon Money Market events using The Neighborhood. The data you're receiving is contains events from the most used Polygon Money Markets, AAVE and Compound V3. In case you want to add new DEXs we encourage you to reach out to us or adjust the template.
