# Welcome to The Neighborhood
__The Neighborhood__ is the fastest way to get transformed, onchain data‚Äîdelivered exactly how you want it.

We meet the data where it lives (in its raw form onchain), and meet you, our neighbor, where you are‚Äîwith your existing infra, like databases, webhooks, or Kafka. That gap is bridged by distributed clusters of nodes we call Neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood is a distributed data processing network developed by [The Indexing Company](https://www.indexing.co), a team focused on providing cutting-edge blockchain data infrastructure. While The Neighborhood powers the pipelines, The Indexing Company helps you deploy, optimize, and debug them. Reach out to us anytime at [hello@indexing.co](mailto:hello@indexing.co) or find us on [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/channel/indexing).

# What You Can Do
Today, the primary way to interact with The Neighborhood is through __pipelines__.

Instead of polling APIs or adapting to rigid subgraph schemas, you get to define:
- What data you want
- How you want it transformed
- Where you want it delivered

Data on demand, just the way you want it.

Each pipeline consists of:
- __Networks__: List of chains to subscribe to
- __Filter__: e.g., contract addresses or wallet addresses
- __Transformation__: JavaScript logic to reshape the data
- __Destination__: Postgres, Webhook, or Kafka

# Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using the `X-API-KEY` header.

To get access, sign up at [accounts.indexing.co](https://accounts.indexing.co), email [hello@indexing.co](mailto:hello@indexing.co), or find us on [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/channel/indexing).

# Multi-Chain Support

The Neighborhood works across many blockchain ecosystems and Virtual Machine (VM) types:
- __EVM__: Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and more
- __SVM__: Solana and related chains
- __MoveVM__: Sui, Aptos, Movement, etc.
- __UTXO__: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, etc.
- __CosmWasm__: Cosmos, Osmosis, Injective and other IBC-compatible chains
