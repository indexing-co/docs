# Overview
The Neighborhood is the quickest way to get transformed, onchain data.

We meet the data where it's at (in its raw form) and you, our neighbor, where you're at with your existing infra (e.g. database or webhook). This gap is bridged with distributed clusters of nodes we call Neighborhoods.

Today, the primary way to leverage The Neighborhood is with pipelines.

<Note>
    Pipelines _push_ data to you. Instead of having to integrate with someone's subgraph or API schema, you simply get to define how the data is processed and where you'd like to receive. Data on demand, just the way you want it.
</Note>

Each pipeline consists of a:
1. List of [networks](/networks) to subscribe to
2. Filter (e.g. wallet addresses)
2. Transformation step (JavaScript)
3. Destination (Postgres, Webhooks)



# Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an authentication header, `X-API-KEY`.
