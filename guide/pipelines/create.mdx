# Destinations

There are currently three flavors of destinations available via self-service APIs: Webhooks, WebSockets, and Postgres.

There are [16 total that are currently supported by Indexing Co](https://indexing-co.notion.site/16e25f031053805da10cf65179f977c6?v=097aa09c71c845db9f88d773385d1f5e) generally though - reach out if you need something else!

## Webhooks

Here's an example payload for creating a pipeline that delivers to a webhook:

```json
{
  ...
  "delivery": {
    "adapter": "HTTP",
    "connection": {
      "host": "https://webhook.site/...",
      "headers": {
        "some-auth-key": "some-auth-key"
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## WebSockets

Here's an example payload for creating a pipeline that delivers to a websocket:

```json
{
  ...
  "delivery": {
    "adapter": "WEBSOCKET",
    "connection": {
      "host": "ws://websocket-host.com/...",
      "headers": {
        "some-auth-key": "some-auth-key"
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## Postgres

Here's an example payload for creating a pipeline that delivers to a Postgres database:

```json
{
  ...
  "delivery": {
    "adapter": "POSTGRES",
    "connectionUri": "postgres://...",
    "table": "vitalik_token_transfers",
    "uniqueKeys": ["transaction_hash", "log_index"]
  },
  ...
}
```

<Note>
  Make sure your database table is already setup! Importantly, this also includes ensuring that there's a unique / primary key index on the table matching the provided `uniqueKeys` in the pipeline.
