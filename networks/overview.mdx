Indexing Co supports 126 networks. _All_ of these are available for real time processing in The Neighborhood.

While the vast majority of these networks are blockchains themselves, we can also support offchain sources such as Farcaster.

The most up to date list can be viewed via an API [here](https://jiti.indexing.co/networks)
